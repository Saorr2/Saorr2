## Hello! ðŸ™‚

â€¢ ðŸŒ± **About Me:**

â€¢ ðŸ“š I'm studying Graphic Information Technology (Full-Stack Web Development) at Arizona State University. I am focusing on front-end and back-end website and application development.

â€¢ ðŸŽ“ After I graduate my goal is to start a successful career as a web developer possibly even a software engineer at a relatively known tech company.

â€¢ ðŸ’» When it comes to coding, my passion is to learn new programming languages as well as to brush up on my coding skills in my free time as I like to strengthen my knowledge in Python, Java, and SQL.

â€¢ âš¡ The hobbies I enjoy the most are coding, drawing, painting, and listening to music.
