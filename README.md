## Hello! ðŸ™‚

ðŸŒ± **About Me:**

ðŸ“š I'm studying Graphic Information Technology (Full-Stack Web Development) at Arizona State University. I am focusing on front-end and back-end website and application development.

ðŸŽ“ After I graduate my goal is to start a successful career as a web developer possibly even a software engineer at a relatively known tech company.

ðŸ’» When it comes to coding, my passion is to learn new programming languages as well as to brush up on my coding skills in my free time. In terms of technical skills I have experience in Python and SQL. The hobbies I enjoy the most are coding, drawing, painting, and listening to music.
